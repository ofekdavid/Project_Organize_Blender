# Project_Organize_Blender
# Start Organized with couple of clicks, work smarter and faster
I am a Maya user, and I like to keep my project folder organized. I want the program to automatically take me to the correct folder each time to save me a few clicks. With this add-on, you can choose a folder path for your project and create it with a single click. The add-on will create the necessary folders with the correct names inside the path. If you want easy access to your projects every time you use Blender, make sure to set your project to the correct folder, and the preferences file paths will update automatically.
